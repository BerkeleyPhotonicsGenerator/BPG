# Berkeley Photonics Generator 
The Berkeley Photonics Generator (BPG) is a Python framework that enables the generation and simulation of photonics layout. BPG leverages the BAG 2.0 framework, and has similar syntax and file structure. BPG is primarily focused on enabling simulation through Lumerical, but other open-source options will be added later

# Installation Instructions
To set up a consistent development file structure and environmental variables, please do not use BPG without Photonics_Dev. Locate, pull, and install via github.com/pvnbhargava/Photonics_Dev

# Basic Usage Instructions

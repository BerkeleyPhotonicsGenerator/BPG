# Berkeley Photonics Generator 
The Berkeley Photonics Generator (BPG) is a Python framework that enables the generation and simulation of photonics layout. BPG leverages the BAG 2.0 framework, and has similar syntax and file structure. BPG is primarily focused on enabling simulation through Lumerical, but other open-source options will be added later

# Installation Instructions
BPG is a plugin to BAG, and relies on it for many basic functions. BAG requires a very specific environment setup; to get a compatible development file structure and environmental variables, please install BPG through Photonics_Dev. Locate, pull, and install via https://github.com/pvnbhargava/Photonics_Dev.

# Basic Usage Instructions

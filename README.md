# Berkeley Photonics Generator 
The Berkeley Photonics Generator (BPG) is a Python framework that enable you to generate and simulate photonics 
layout. BPG leverages the BAG 2.0 framework, and has similar syntax and file structure. BPG is primarily focused on 
enabling simulation through Lumerical, but other open-source options will be added later

# Installation Instructions
BPG is a plugin to BAG, and relies on it for many core functions. BAG requires a very specific environment setup; 
to get a compatible development file structure with environmental variables, please install BPG through Photonics_Dev. 
Locate, pull, and install via https://github.com/pvnbhargava/Photonics_Dev.

# Documentation
Once cloned, the most up to date BPG user manual can be found at `./BPG/docs/BPG_User_Manual.pdf`. Alternatively, you
can read it online [here](docs/BPG_User_Manual.pdf). A readthedocs website will be hosted once the repo is made public

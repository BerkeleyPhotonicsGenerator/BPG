Gdspy is a Python  module for creating/importing/merging GDSII stream files.
It includes key libraries for creating complex CAD layouts:

* Boolean operations on polygons (AND, OR, NOT, XOR) based on clipping algorithm
* Polygon offset (inward and outward rescaling of polygons)
* Efficient point-in-polygon solutions for large array sets

Gdspy also includes a simple layout viewer.

Typical applications of gdspy are in the fields of electronic chip design, planar lightwave circuit design, and mechanical engineering.

## Installation

### Dependencies:

* [Python](http://www.python.org/) (tested with versions 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6)
* [Numpy](http://numpy.scipy.org/)
* [Python-future](http://python-future.org/) (only for Python 2)
* Tkinter (optional: needed for the `LayoutViewer` GUI)
* C compiler (needed only if built from source)

### Linux / OS X

Option 1: using [pip](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/):

```sh
pip install gdspy
```

Option 2: download the source from [github](https://github.com/heitzmann/gdspy) and build/install with:

```sh
python setup.py install
```

### Windows

The preferred option is to install pre-compiled binaries from [here](https://github.com/heitzmann/gdspy/releases).

Installation via `pip` and building from source as above are also possible, but an appropriate [build environment](https://wiki.python.org/moin/WindowsCompilers) is required for compilation of the C extension modules.

## Documentation

The complete [documentation](http://gdspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) can be built from the sources in the `docs` folder with [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/).

The file [tutorial.py](https://github.com/heitzmann/gdspy/blob/master/examples/tutorial.py) in the `example` folder is a sample script to show the features provided by this module.

* All classes were adapted to work with the boolean operations.
* The attribute size in the initializer of class `Text` does not have a default value any longer.

### Version 0.1.6 (December 15,  2009)
* Sample script now include comments and creates an easier to understand GDSII example.
* Improved floating point to integer rounding, which fixes the unit errors at the last digit of the precision in the GDSII file.
